ASPECT_INTERPRETATIONS = {
    "Trine": (
        "Complete, automatic connection and collaboration. "
        "What happens to one happens to the other ‚Äì these two planets are attached at the hip, "
        "total besties, zero resistance, zero interference. Full mutual signal transfer."
    ),
    "Sextile": (
        "Potential for strong harmonious connection, much like the trine, but not automatic. "
        "Sextiles are opportunities for two planets to work together and develop a latent talent. "
        "They require choice and active participation under normal circumstances ‚Äì "
        "but can be automatically activated by transits."
    ),
    "Square": (
        "Work. Square does not necessarily mean conflict, but it always means work; "
        "two planets that must work to reconcile their differences because they both feel "
        "like the other is shoving them from the side and totally interfering with their trajectory. "
        "They can be reconciled, and need to be ‚Äì the keys are in the other two points "
        "that complete the grand cross."
    ),
    "Conjunction": (
        "Two or more planets that share the same perspective and location. "
        "They work together as a singular node. If they are planets that naturally have a tense "
        "relationship, such as Saturn and Uranus, then they can sometimes be tough roommates "
        "together until the two archetypes are resolved into a working friendship."
    ),
    "Opposition": (
        "The balance of opposites, like Yin and Yang. Each set of polarities is complementary, "
        "but the tendency is for them to compete when ungrounded. "
        "The dichotomy in a classic heterosexual marriage diagram explains the opposite polarities well: "
        "either the man and woman recognize that they have different but complementary poles "
        "and honor their differences, creating symbiotic balance, "
        "or they compete, trying to dominate or control one another out of competition, superiority, or insecurity. "
        "All major oppositions in a natal chart represent the major over-arching themes of the native‚Äôs life. "
        "They are polarities that the native is always working to keep in balance, or their life goes out of balance."
    ),
    "Sesquisquare": (
        "Activation overflow. This is an aspect of momentum, compulsion, and often service. "
        "One planet reaches full activation, and the sesquisquare acts like a surge line ‚Äî "
        "it pushes energy into the other planet, activating it in a new capacity. "
        "It‚Äôs not smooth like a trine, nor tense like a square ‚Äî it‚Äôs quick, sometimes surprising, "
        "and highly energetic. These are often 'helper circuits' or 'gift-wired compulsions,' "
        "where someone finds themselves acting or serving without even planning to, simply because "
        "the conditions are right for them to be 'in their element.' "
        "They can be hijacked without good boundaries, but when integrated, "
        "sesquisquares unlock multidimensional creativity and functional genius."
    ),
    "Quincunx": (
        "A misaligned connection that demands adjustment. These planets feel like they should connect ‚Äî "
        "there‚Äôs tension and urgency ‚Äî but the angles don‚Äôt support clean communication or mutual understanding. "
        "This creates frustration, indecision, awkward compensations, or even complete disaster when pushed "
        "against hard enough ‚Äì until a new integration pathway is consciously invented. "
        "It‚Äôs like trying to plug a round wire into a triangular socket. "
        "You‚Äôre likely to fry or break something if you try too hard. "
        "Quincunxes often signal health issues, compulsions that always seem to go badly, "
        "patterns of bad luck, repeated disaster/trauma signatures, or parts of self that never seem to belong‚Ä¶ "
        "until the chart holder invents a whole new framework to hold them."
